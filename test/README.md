Currently, all integration tests are found in `test/runtests.jl`, though this might change once some test suites are automated.
There are also doctests in the doctrings of `src/PreprocessMD.jl` and in the example pipeline of `test/src/index.md`.


Guidelines for tests:
- Tests should be organized and categorized systematically based on the type of test.
- Tests should cover the entire source code and address any use case.
